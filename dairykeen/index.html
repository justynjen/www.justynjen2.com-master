  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <hr />
  <p> Hi, I'm Justyn Gourdin. I started traveling the world two years ago. I have run a travel blog ever since leaving home but found that I enjoyed redesigning websites as much as I loved writing on my blog. Recently I made some friends in Bali who showed me the beauty of web design and I finished a world class coding course. I am now ready to start my own business around the world. Fusing my love for writing and visual design with my new found love for web desin. You can view the website that I built during the course and my blog here at: www.justynjen.com and www.adventuresofamiddlechild.com </p>

  <h2> Mission </h2>
  <hr />

  <p> As you know, Heber is a well traveled town. New people are passing through every day and tourists these days are going to the internet to find their meal experiences. It is so important in a city like this, to have a strong online presence. I took a look at some of the Dairy Keen "competition", namely Grannie's, as it has recently come under new ownership and gotten it's own web redesign. After checking out their site, I was even more compelled to assist you in revamping your design. You need to have a website with a competative edge and great SEO that drives new customers to your location so you don't lose these customers to other businesses based solely on the web. </p>

  <h2> Objective </h2>
  <hr />
  <p> The objective is to overhaul the existing site to better reflect and showcase the brand. The focus will be on making the new site: </p>
  <ul>
     <li> visually stunning design </li>
     <li> simple, user-friendly navigation that encourages users to browse further </li>
     <li> SEO (Search Engine Optimised) site for strong rankings for relevant key words</li>
     <li> fast to load and compatible across all modern browsers</li>
     <li> easy for non-technical users to update and maintain </li>
     <li> mobile and tablet friendly (responsive) design </li>
     <li> built in the latest web technologies</li>
     <li> A form for your customers to sign up for your frequent diners club</li>
     <li> create an email list to share deals and specials with your club members</li>
     <li> assistance in producing higher quality images of your products and location </li>
  </ul>

  <p> To really understand the best way forward, I would love to chat with you about your current challenges with your website. From a brief analysis I notice that it can be a little clunky to navigate. The design is not reflecting the modern, innovative brand and nothing about your website tells about the amazing family oriented local company that you are. I would love to hear about how well it's converting new customers and if any existing customers have mentioned using your website or sharing it with anyone. </p>

  <h2> Process </h2>
  <hr />
  <p> <span>Step 1 - Strategy:</span> I'll engage in a 1x hour Skype strategy call with relevant key parties to discuss goals, the brand, important features and functionality, etc. I'll then go away and come away with a comprehensive website strategy, and design inspiration. </p>

  <p> <span>Step 2 - Design:</span> I'll put together a style tile, wireframe and homepage design that showcases the planned design and UX of the site for your review. This design will be optimised not just to be visually stunning, but to load fast and be easy to update and maintain. It will also be planned with an understanding of the psychology of the user. This will take 1 - 2 weeks. </p>

  <p> <span>Step 3 - Development:</span> After you have reviewed and approved the design we'll get to work building it. We'll be building from scratch using HTML, CSS and Javascript (no clunky pre-built templates here). I'll conduct comprehensive browser testing, speed testing and website optimisation. This process will take around 2 - 3 weeks depending on the scope of the design that we agree on.  </p>

  <p> <span>Step 4 - Review & Upload Content:</span> Now it's time to review the live site (on a hidden domain), upload all of your content (photos, images etc) and teach you how to use the content management system.  </p>

  <h2> Estimate </h2>
  <hr />
  <p>
    Based on the information I have uncovered from viewing your current website, the number of pages and the complexity of the UX I estimate a total cost of around $2750 - $3000 for this comprehensive package. This can include functionality like exit intent pop-ups, proffesional photos taken of your food and location, etc. After the initial consultation we can provide a firm quote. Because of my relationship with your family, I would love to offer you this package at an additional 35% off the quoted price.
    ****On top of this I would like to mention/offer to you one more add on. I noticed a lot of similar issues for your second web page for your motel. The design seems to be outdate and both sites are lacking any call to action, grabbing the attention of new viewers. I would love to help you with both sites, adding on the Swiss Alps Inn for an additional $1000. We will treat it like an entirely different project but both projects will be finshed at about the same time.
