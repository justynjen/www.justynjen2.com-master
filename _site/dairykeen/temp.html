      <h1>Website Redesign Project for the Dairy Keen</h1>
      <h2>Proposed by Justyn Gourdin</h2>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <div id="about" class="grid">
        <p>Your website is often the first impression that someone has with your brand. Yes you may have heard this 100 times but it continues to be true. Customers are always on the internet, searching for reviews and recomendations as to what restaurant they should eat at, what city they should visit and what tour they should book. It is important that when a user lands on your site they immediatley want to book with you or visit your shop. A website should be a creative, unique and sleek example of everything that your brand has to offer to your audience.</p>
        <p>You should hire me because I have an emphasis on User Experience and User Design. This means that I am looking for what your users want to see. I am able to make you a clean website that will keep customers coming back again and again.</p>

      <h3>Problem</h3>
      <p>I had a look over the Dairy Keen's website and right away I noticed things that we can change. You need to have a compelling front page that entices people right away to come to your location. You need to include some sort of call to action that says, come in this week for this grea deal! Visit us this month for this special offer. Another reason to update your site would be to give it a modern look. You want a clean design that focuses entirely on your business and your products. Anything that will drive your online customers into your locations.</p>

      <h3>Goals</h3>
      <p>I will create a whole new website for you. I will take your ideas, create a wire frame and let you know what I have in mind to keep your website modern. We can have a look at other peoples websites that are totally killing it, and we can work off those. Taking elements that you like and making them better. Giving your company an edge on the web that they didn't have before.</p>
