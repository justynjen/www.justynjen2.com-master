  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <hr />
  <p> Hi, I'm Justyn Gourdin. I started traveling the world two years ago. I have run a travel blog ever since leaving home but found that I enjoyed redesigning websites as much as I loved writing on my blog. Recently I made some friends in Bali who showed me the beauty of web design and I finished a world class coding course. I am now ready to start my own business around the world. Fusing my love for writing and visual design with my new found love for web desin. You can view the website that I built during the course and my blog here at: www.justynjen.com and www.adventuresofamiddlechild.com </p>

  <h2> Mission </h2>
  <hr />

  <p> To properly inspire your congregation you need o remind them what's up and coming on your website. You need to include things like church quotes, inspiration from their pastor and even more. As you may know, people these days spend 99% of their time on their phones. Make your website a refreshing, reminder that you love your congregation, and that God loves your congregation. Make your website a safe haven they can go to for inspiration. A website is a great way for you to interact with your community and continue to touch the lives of those around you! </p>

  <h2> Objective </h2>
  <hr />
  <p> The objective is to redo the whole site making a new site to inspire your members. The focus will be on making the new site: </p>
  <ul>
     <li> beautiful </li>
     <li> simple, user-friendly navigation that encourages users to browse further </li>
     <li> fast to load and mobile reponsive</li>
     <li> easy for non-technical users to update and maintain </li>
     <li> thought for the week from pastor Brett</li>
     <li> a calendar for your congregation to see what's new </li>
     <li> Sunday and Wednesday lesson themes</li>
     <li> sermon topic and key scriptures</li>
     <li> community updates and a "get to know us" for new members</li>
     <li> email reminders </li>
  </ul>

  <p> To really understand the best way forward, I would love to chat with you about your current challenges with your website. From a brief analysis I notice that it shows no information about your teachins. You want a website that inspires readers and helps them to feel the love and sense of community that your congregation has. The design is not reflecting the modern, innovative brand and nothing about your website tells about the amazing family oriented local company that you are. </p>

  <h2> Process </h2>
  <hr />
  <p> <span>Step 1 - Strategy:</span> I'll engage in a 1x hour Skype strategy call with relevant key parties to discuss goals, the brand, important features and functionality, etc. I'll then go away and come away with a comprehensive website strategy, and design inspiration. </p>

  <p> <span>Step 2 - Design:</span> I'll put together a style tile, wireframe and homepage design that showcases the planned design and UX of the site for your review. This design will be optimised not just to be visually stunning, but to load fast and be easy to update and maintain. It will also be planned with an understanding of the psychology of the user. This will take 1 - 2 weeks. </p>

  <p> <span>Step 3 - Development:</span> After you have reviewed and approved the design we'll get to work building it. We'll be building from scratch using HTML, CSS and Javascript (no clunky pre-built templates here). I'll conduct comprehensive browser testing, speed testing and website optimisation. This process will take around 2 - 3 weeks depending on the scope of the design that we agree on.  </p>

  <p> <span>Step 4 - Review & Upload Content:</span> Now it's time to review the live site (on a hidden domain), upload all of your content (photos, images etc) and teach you how to use the content management system.  </p>

  <h2> Estimate </h2>
  <hr />
  <p>
    Based on the information I have uncovered from viewing your current website, the number of pages and the complexity of the UX I estimate a total cost of around $500 for this comprehensive package. This will include if you are interested, a form for your readers to engage in a weekly church newletter. After the initial consultation we can provide a firm quote.
